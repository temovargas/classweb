                <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with
                    canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                    camping
                    experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
                    facilities
                    are located in the lodge.</dd>
                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of
                    clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
